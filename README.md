```bash
cd nodejs-on-ec2
npm install
```

Start the application
To start the application, run the below command in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3: Deploy Node JS project using PM2

Git clone or upload your project in your server
Goto your project directory and install npm packages

```bash
npm install
```

Install PM2 package globally

```bash
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```

To Install latest pm2 package

```bash
sudo npm install@latest pm2 -g
```

Or run the following command for show the list

```bash
sudo pm2 ls
```

Check your application in browser, is it working or not
To stop or restart application

```bash
sudo pm2 ls
```

To stop or restart application

```bash
sudo pm2 stop 0
sudo pm2 restart 0
